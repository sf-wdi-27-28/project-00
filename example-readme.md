# Racing Game

*Short explanation of the project (1-2 sentences) - what is the goal of the project and/or main functionality?*
This is a short race game that combines a maze and sprites, similar to pac-man. The goal is to reach the finish shoot first without being eat by a sprite.

## Technologies Used

*What technologies did you use to develop this project? (bullet points)*
I used object oriented programming as a basis for the project. Each space is an object for a player to move into, with walls having an "impassible" trait.

## Existing Features

*What features does your racing game have? (bullet points)*
Features include 2D movement, score keeping, and a reset button.

## Planned Features

*What changes would you make to your project if you continue to work on it? (bullet points)*
I would like to add a save button, a count down and refine the sprite movements. I also would have like to make the game better looking overall.
